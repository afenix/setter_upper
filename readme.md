#Project builder v2.0 is here to help make your project set up a little quicker. There are two scripts written: the first will create your Postgres databases and tables (aptly titled the postgres_tool.rb), while project_make_v2.rb builds your directory structure, adds files, and will auto-populate base code in the Gemfile, Rakefile, app.rb, layout.erb, README.md and database.yml. Project make v2.0 was built off the solid bones of Dan's project builder by Alister. 

Version 2 is now updated to auto-populate base language in the Gemfile, Rakefile, app.rb, layout.erb, and database.yml.
Should work on pretty much anything but windows.

#Maintainers:
Check out project_make.rb to see the legacy of this code.  As Dan said in the original README "Like I guess whoevers trynna mess with it. Fork it." That's what I did, so you should too.
