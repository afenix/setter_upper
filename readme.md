#Project builder script v 2.0 built off the solid bones of Dan's project builder by Alister.

Version 2 is now updated to auto-populate base language in the Gemfile, Rakefile, app.rb, layout.erb, and database.yml.
Should work on pretty much anything but windows.

#Maintainers:
Check out project_make.rb to see the legacy of this code.  As Dan said in the original README "Like I guess whoevers trynna mess with it. Fork it." That's what I did, so you should too.
